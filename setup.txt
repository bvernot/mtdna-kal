[File structure]

Notes from Johann:

ben vernot  3:12 PM
Hey guys - I want to try to be a good scientist, and make some of my code more "reproducible," as the kids say. This particular project is currently set up as several programs / bash scripts that I run sequentially, and it generates a *ton* of intermediate files. I was thinking I'd put those all together in a snakemake script, and try not to have it rely on our local file structure. Is that the preferred way?
One other problem - it requires some other software (treetime). Is it ok to just say "you need to install this" in the readme?

Johann  3:18 PM
I see treetime is in Bioconda. If you’re using Snakemake, it’s pretty trivial to make it run the relevant rule in a conda environment that has treetime installed.
3:20
If you use a standard Snakemake file layout as per https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/deployment.html, then you’ll have a (say) workflow/envs/treetime.yaml that looks something like this…
3:21
Untitled 
name: ben_workflow_treetime
channels:
  - bioconda
dependencies:
  - treetime==0.8.4


3:21
Then in the Snakefile, you’ll just have…
3:23
Untitled 
rule treetime              # or whatever...
    conda:
        "envs/treetime.yaml"
# ...rest of rule goes here


3:23
All assuming you’re using Snakemake. That’s of course just one option. :grimacing:

ben vernot  3:25 PM
This is great, thanks! I didn't know about the "standard snakemake file layout" - that's also really helpful.

Johann  3:32 PM
I forgot to add: You’ll have to run snakemake with --use-conda, or with --profile pointing to a profile file that has use-conda: true

Johann  3:45 PM
@ben vernot … you could stick your pipeline up on vcs.eva and we can help out. (No guarantees how much time I’ll have in the intermediate future…)
